#  About this book

Environmental Intelligence and its salient functional qualities of pattern recognition, contextualisation and theorisation - provide the possibility of producing contemporary and novel hypotheses to address a number of critical elements in the decarbonisation ambitions of global governments. The mission of this book is to provide Environmental Intelligence students with open resources to navigate the computational aspect of their work. Included in the book are three chapters covering data science, cloud computing and command line tooling and a final chapter linking out to other useful resources to assist you on your EI journey.
